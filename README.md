# Accessibility Morning Challenge (60 minutes)

### Learning outcomes
The learning outcomes of this Morning Challenge are as follows:
- Replace the HTML elements with more semantic elements
  - Use tags such as `section`, `header`, `article`, `footer`, etc.
- Use the label tag around/for the input tag.
  - The `label` element is used to explicitly associate a form control with the label.
  - `Labels` are an accessibility feature that allows screen readers to voice the input prompt to the user.
- Tab index
  - The significance of tab-index to the students
  - Adding tab-index = 0, makes any element focusable.
  - The element has to be interactive from a keyboard and/or a screenreader.
- Aria
  - You can use the role attribute to change an element's role, e.g.:
      - By giving the role button to a div, which tells screen readers that the div is actually a button!
