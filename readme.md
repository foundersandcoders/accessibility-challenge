# Accessibility Morning Challenge (60 minutes)

1. Clone this repo
```
https://github.com/njsfield/accessibility-challenge.git
```

2. Open the index.html file
3. Using your test editor, improve as many semantic/accessibility issues littered throughout the file as you can!
4. To help you start, I'd recommend downloading [this](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) useful plugin for Atom.
5. Use one of the many available accessibility checking tools available online to help you.
